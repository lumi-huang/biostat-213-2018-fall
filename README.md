- midterm:  
Assume that your restaurant opens at 8am and closes at 5pm. Customers arrive at a rate of 4/hr. Between the hours of noon and 1 that rate increases to 6/hr. Suppose you have 3 tellers. We have studied 3 types of queuing systems. Given three tellers which queuing system has the shortest expected waiting time for the customers?
- final:  
In the previous results it was found that having one line for 3 tellers had a slightly smaller expected waiting time than the queuing system where each teller had their own line.  Is there a way to make these 2 queuing systems equivalent? That is can we design a mechanism such that the three-line system is equivalent to the one-line system.  For example, what if we let people switch lines but only allowed the person who had been waiting the longest to switch?  What if we let the person who just arrived switch?  
In the tandem system, does it matter where you put the slowest teller?  That is, does the expected waiting time change if the slowest teller is teller 1 or teller 2 or teller 3?
